## 💭 Reflection

### 🔍 Challenges Faced
- Designing fully responsive layouts across screen sizes
- Managing data updates and re-renders without backend persistence
- Creating dynamic filters, sort, and pagination in vanilla JavaScript

### 💡 Improvements If Given More Time
- Store data in browser localStorage or IndexedDB for persistence
- Add unit tests for form validation and DOM updates
- Include transition animations for better UX
- Implement bulk actions or export to CSV option
